# Elemental Explorer

---

## I. Project Overview

The provided code is a Python application built using the Tkinter library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs). It serves as the foundation for the Elemental Explorer, a quiz-based periodic table learning tool. The code implements a structured, interactive framework that manages different aspects of the user experience, from data handling to interface interactions. It includes two main features:

1. **Periodic Table Viewer**: View and explore detailed information about chemical elements, their properties, and their positions in the periodic table.
2. **Periodic Table Game**: A quiz-style game that challenges users to answer questions about element symbols and atomic numbers, promoting learning through play.

Elemental Explorer aims to make learning chemistry fun and accessible, catering to students, educators, and enthusiasts alike.

## II. Python Concepts, Libraries, and Features

This project demonstrates the following Python concepts and libraries:

1. **Tkinter GUI**:
   - A user-friendly graphical interface with buttons, labels, and entry fields for intuitive navigation.
   - Icons and custom styles to enhance user experience.
   - Canvas graphics for displaying the periodic table.

2. **Random Library**:
   - Generates random questions for diverse gameplay.

3. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:
   - Encapsulation of application functionality into classes and methods for modularity and reusability.

4. **Error Handling and Input Validation**:
   - Ensures users provide valid inputs before proceeding:
     - Displays prompts for incomplete fields, such as missing number of questions.
     - Prevents invalid entries like numbers outside the range of 1â€“100.

5. **Dynamic Feedback**:
   - Provides real-time feedback for quiz answers, such as correct/incorrect responses and the final score.
